# NOTE: Breaking API changes get pushed directly to this Inkwell branch, so be
# very careful when running `cargo update` to get a new revision into Cargo.lock.
#
# We have to depend on `branch` instead of a specific `rev` here because, although
# `rev` works locally, it causes an error on GitHub Actions. (It's unclear why,
# but after several hours of trying unsuccessfully to fix it, `branch` is it.)
