# NOTE: roc-lang/inkwell is a fork of TheDan64/inkwell which does not change anything.
#
# The reason for this fork is that the way Inkwell is designed, you have to use
# a particular branch (e.g. "llvm8-0") in Cargo.toml. That would be fine, except that
# breaking changes get pushed directly to that branch, which breaks our build
# without warning.
#
# We tried referencing a specific rev on TheDan64/inkwell directly (instead of branch),
# but although that worked locally, it did not work on GitHub Actions. (After a few
# hours of investigation, gave up trying to figure out why.) So this is the workaround:
# having an immutable tag on the roc-lang/inkwell fork which points to
# a particular "release" of Inkwell.
#
# When we want to update Inkwell, we can sync up roc-lang/inkwell to the latest
# commit of TheDan64/inkwell, push a new tag which points to the latest commit,
# change the tag value in this Cargo.toml to point to that tag, and `cargo update`.
# This way, GitHub Actions works and nobody's builds get broken.
# TODO: Switch this back to roc-lang/inkwell once it is updated
