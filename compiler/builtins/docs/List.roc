## Types

## A sequential list of values.
##
## >>> [ 1, 2, 3 ] # a list of numbers
## >>> [ "a", "b", "c" ] # a list of strings
## >>> [ [ 1.1 ], [], [ 2.2, 3.3 ] ] # a list of lists of numbers
##
## The list `[ 1, "a" ]` gives an error, because each element in a list must have
## the same type. If you want to put a mix of [I64] and [Str] values into a list, try this:
##
## ```
## mixedList : List [ IntElem I64, StrElem Str ]*
## mixedList = [ IntElem 1, IntElem 2, StrElem "a", StrElem "b" ]
## ```
##
## The maximum size of a [List] is limited by the amount of heap memory available
## to the current process. If there is not enough memory available, attempting to
## create the list could crash. (On Linux, where [overcommit](https://www.etalabs.net/overcommit.html)
## is normally enabled, not having enough memory could result in the list appearing
## to be created just fine, but then crashing later.)
##
## > The theoretical maximum length for a list created in Roc is half of
## > `Num.maxNat`. Attempting to create a list bigger than that
## > in Roc code will always fail, although in practice it is likely to fail
## > at much smaller lengths due to insufficient memory being available.
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## Under the hood, a list is a record containing a `len : Nat` field as well
## as a pointer to a reference count and a flat array of bytes. Unique lists
## store a capacity #Nat instead of a reference count.
##
## ## Shared Lists
##
## Shared lists are [reference counted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting).
##
## Each time a given list gets referenced, its reference count ("refcount" for short)
## gets incremented. Each time a list goes out of scope, its refcount count gets
## decremented. Once a refcount, has been decremented more times than it has been
## incremented, we know nothing is referencing it anymore, and the list's memory
## will be immediately freed.
##
## Let's look at an example.
##
##     ratings = [ 5, 4, 3 ]
##
##     { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
##
## The first line binds the name `ratings` to the list `[ 5, 4, 3 ]`. The list
## begins with a refcount of 1, because so far only `ratings` is referencing it.
##
## The second line alters this refcount. `{ foo: ratings` references
## the `ratings` list, which will result in its refcount getting incremented
## from 0 to 1. Similarly, `bar: ratings }` also references the `ratings` list,
## which will result in its refcount getting incremented from 1 to 2.
##
## Let's turn this example into a function.
##
##     getRatings = \first ->
##         ratings = [ first, 4, 3 ]
##
##         { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
##
##     getRatings 5
##
## At the end of the `getRatings` function, when the record gets returned,
## the original `ratings =` binding has gone out of scope and is no longer
## accessible. (Trying to reference `ratings` outside the scope of the
## `getRatings` function would be an error!)
##
## Since `ratings` represented a way to reference the list, and that way is no
## longer accessible, the list's refcount gets decremented when `ratings` goes
## out of scope. It will decrease from 2 back down to 1.
##
## Putting these together, when we call `getRatings 5`, what we get back is
## a record with two fields, `foo`, and `bar`, each of which refers to the same
## list, and that list has a refcount of 1.
##
## Let's change the last line to be `(getRatings 5).bar` instead of `getRatings 5`:
##
##     getRatings = \first ->
##         ratings = [ first, 4, 3 ]
##
##         { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
##
##     (getRatings 5).bar
##
## Now, when this expression returns, only the `bar` field of the record will
## be returned. This will mean that the `foo` field becomes inaccessible, causing
## the list's refcount to get decremented from 2 to 1. At this point, the list is back
## where it started: there is only 1 reference to it.
##
## Finally let's suppose the final line were changed to this:
##
##     List.first (getRatings 5).bar
##
## This call to [List.first] means that even the list in the `bar` field has become
## inaccessible. As such, this line will cause the list's refcount to get
## decremented all the way to 0. At that point, nothing is referencing the list
## anymore, and its memory will get freed.
##
## Things are different if this is a list of lists instead of a list of numbers.
## Let's look at a simpler example using [List.first] - first with a list of numbers,
## and then with a list of lists, to see how they differ.
##
## Here's the example using a list of numbers.
##
##     nums = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
##
##     first = List.first nums
##     last = List.last nums
##
##     first
##
## It makes a list, calls [List.first] and [List.last] on it, and then returns `first`.
##
## Here's the equivalent code with a list of lists:
##
##     lists = [ [ 1 ], [ 2, 3 ], [], [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ] ]
##
##     first = List.first lists
##     last = List.last lists
##
##     first
##
## TODO explain how in the former example, when we go to free `nums` at the end,
## we can free it immediately because there are no other refcounts. However,
## in the case of `lists`, we have to iterate through the list and decrement
## the refcounts of each of its contained lists - because they, too, have
## refcounts! Importantly, because the first element had its refcount incremented
## because the function returned `first`, that element will actually end up
## *not* getting freed at the end - but all the others will be.
##
## In the `lists` example, `lists = [ ... ]` also creates a list with an initial
## refcount of 1. Separately, it also creates several other lists - each with
## their own refcounts - to go inside that list. (The empty list at the end
## does not use heap memory, and thus has no refcount.)
##
## At the end, we once again call [List.first] on the list, but this time
##
## * Copying small lists (64 elements or fewer) is typically slightly faster than copying small persistent data structures. This is because, at small sizes, persistent data structures tend to be thin wrappers around flat arrays anyway. They don't have any copying advantage until crossing a certain minimum size threshold.
## * Even when copying is faster, other list operations may still be slightly slower with persistent data structures. For example, even if it were a persistent data structure, [List.map], [List.walk], and [List.keepIf] would all need to traverse every element in the list and build up the result from scratch. These operations are all
## * Roc's compiler optimizes many list operations into in-place mutations behind the scenes, depending on how the list is being used. For example, [List.map], [List.keepIf], and [List.set] can all be optimized to perform in-place mutations.
## * If possible, it is usually best for performance to use large lists in a way where the optimizer can turn them into in-place mutations. If this is not possible, a persistent data structure might be faster - but this is a rare enough scenario that it would not be good for the average Roc program's performance if this were the way [List] worked by default. Instead, you can look outside Roc's standard modules for an implementation of a persistent data structure - likely built using [List] under the hood!
List elem : [ @List elem ]

## Initialize

## A list with a single element in it.
##
## This is useful in pipelines, like so:
##
##     websites =
##         Str.concat domain ".com"
##             |> List.single
##
single : elem -> List elem

## An empty list.
empty : List *

## Returns a list with the given length, where every element is the given value.
##
##
repeat : elem, Nat -> List elem

## Returns a list of all the integers between one and another,
## including both of the given numbers.
##
## >>> List.range 2 8
range : Int a, Int a -> List (Int a)

## Transform

## Returns the list with its elements reversed.
##
## >>> List.reverse [ 1, 2, 3 ]
reverse : List elem -> List elem

## Sorts a list using a function which specifies how two elements are ordered.
##
## When sorting by numeric values, it's more efficient to use [sortAsc] or
## [sortDesc] instead.
sort : List elem, (elem, elem -> [ Lt, Eq, Gt ]) -> List elem

## Sorts a list in ascending order (lowest to highest), using a function which
## specifies a way to represent each element as a number.
##
## This is more efficient than [sort] because it skips
## calculating the `[ Lt, Eq, Gt ]` value and uses the number directly instead.
##
## To sort in descending order (highest to lowest), use [List.sortDesc] instead.
sortAsc : List elem, (elem -> Num *) -> List elem

## Sorts a list in descending order (highest to lowest), using a function which
## specifies a way to represent each element as a number.
##
## This is more efficient than [sort] because it skips
## calculating the `[ Lt, Eq, Gt ]` value and uses the number directly instead.
##
## To sort in ascending order (lowest to highest), use [List.sortAsc] instead.
sortDesc : List elem, (elem -> Num *) -> List elem

## Convert each element in the list to something new, by calling a conversion
## function on each of them. Then return a new list of the converted values.
##
## > List.map [ 1, 2, 3 ] (\num -> num + 1)
##
## > List.map [ "", "a", "bc" ] Str.isEmpty
##
## `map` functions like this are common in Roc, and they all work similarly.
## See for example `Set.map`, `Dict.map`, and [Result.map].
map : List before, (before -> after) -> List after

## Run a transformation function on the first element of each list,
## and use that as the first element in the returned list.
## Repeat until a list runs out of elements.
##
## Some languages have a function named `zip`, which does something similar to
## calling [List.map2] passing two lists and `Pair`:
##
## >>> zipped = List.map2 [ "a", "b", "c" ] [ 1, 2, 3 ] Pair
map2 : List a, List b, (a, b -> c) -> List c

## Run a transformation function on the first element of each list,
## and use that as the first element in the returned list.
## Repeat until a list runs out of elements.
map3 : List a, List b, List c, (a, b, c -> d) -> List d

## Run a transformation function on the first element of each list,
## and use that as the first element in the returned list.
## Repeat until a list runs out of elements.
map4 : List a, List b, List c, List d, (a, b, c, d -> e) -> List e

## This works like [List.map], except it also passes the index
## of the element to the conversion function.
mapWithIndex : List before, (before, Nat -> after) -> List after

## This works like [List.map], except at any time you can return `Err` to
## cancel the entire operation immediately, and return that #Err.
mapOrCancel : List before, (before -> Result after err) -> Result (List after) err

## Like [List.map], except the transformation function specifies whether to
## `Keep` or `Drop` each element from the final [List].
##
## You may know a similar function named `filterMap` in other languages.
mapOrDrop : List before, (before -> [ Keep after, Drop ]) -> List after

## Like [List.map], except the transformation function wraps the return value
## in a list. At the end, all the lists get joined together into one list.
##
## You may know a similar function named `concatMap` in other languages.
mapJoin : List before, (before -> List after) -> List after

## This works like [List.map], except only the transformed values that are
## wrapped in `Ok` are kept. Any that are wrapped in `Err` are dropped.
##
## >>> List.mapOks [ [ "a", "b" ], [], [], [ "c", "d", "e" ] ] List.last
##
## >>> fn = \str -> if Str.isEmpty str then Err StrWasEmpty else Ok (Str.len str)
## >>>
## >>> List.mapOks [ "", "a", "bc", "", "d", "ef", "" ]
mapOks : List before, (before -> Result after *) -> List after

## Returns a list with the element at the given index having been transformed by
## the given function.
##
## For a version of this which gives you more control over when to perform
## the transformation, see `List.updater`
##
## ## Performance notes
##
## In particular when updating nested collections, this is potentially much more
## efficient than using [List.get] to obtain the element, transforming it,
## and then putting it back in the same place.
update : List elem, Nat, (elem -> elem) -> List elem

## A more flexible version of `List.update`, which returns an "updater" function
## that lets you delay performing the update until later.
updater : List elem, Nat -> { elem, new : (elem -> List elem) }

## If all the elements in the list are #Ok, return a new list containing the
## contents of those #Ok tags. If any elements are #Err, return #Err.
allOks : List (Result ok err) -> Result (List ok) err

## Add a single element to the end of a list.
##
## >>> List.append [ 1, 2, 3 ] 4
##
## >>> [ 0, 1, 2 ]
## >>>     |> List.append 3
append : List elem, elem -> List elem

## Add a single element to the beginning of a list.
##
## >>> List.prepend [ 1, 2, 3 ] 0
##
## >>> [ 2, 3, 4 ]
## >>>     |> List.prepend 1
prepend : List elem, elem -> List elem

## Put two lists together.
##
## >>> List.concat [ 1, 2, 3 ] [ 4, 5 ]
##
## >>> [ 0, 1, 2 ]
## >>>     |> List.concat [ 3, 4 ]
concat : List elem, List elem -> List elem

## Join the given lists together into one list.
##
## >>> List.join [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5 ], [], [ 6, 7 ] ]
##
## >>> List.join [ [], [] ]
##
## >>> List.join []
join : List (List elem) -> List elem

## Like [List.join], but only keeps elements tagged with `Ok`. Elements
## tagged with `Err` are dropped.
##
## This can be useful after using an operation that returns a #Result
## on each element of a list, for example [List.first]:
##
## >>> [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [], [], [ 4, 5 ] ]
## >>>     |> List.map List.first
## >>>     |> List.joinOks
##
## Eventually, `oks` type signature will be `List [Ok elem]* -> List elem`.
## The implementation for that is a lot tricker then `List (Result elem *)`
## so we're sticking with `Result` for now.
oks : List (Result elem *) -> List elem

## Filter

## Run the given function on each element of a list, and return all the
## elements for which the function returned `True`.
##
## >>> List.keepIf [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (\num -> num > 2)
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## [List.keepIf] always returns a list that takes up exactly the same amount
## of memory as the original, even if its length decreases. This is because it
## can't know in advance exactly how much space it will need, and if it guesses a
## length that's too low, it would have to re-allocate.
##
## (If you want to do an operation like this which reduces the memory footprint
## of the resulting list, you can do two passes over the lis with [List.walk] - one
## to calculate the precise new size, and another to populate the new list.)
##
## If given a unique list, [List.keepIf] will mutate it in place to assemble the appropriate list.
## If that happens, this function will not allocate any new memory on the heap.
## If all elements in the list end up being kept, Roc will return the original
## list unaltered.
##
keepIf : List elem, (elem -> Bool) -> List elem

## Run the given function on each element of a list, and return all the
## elements for which the function returned `False`.
##
## >>> List.dropIf [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (\num -> num > 2)
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## `List.dropIf` has the same performance characteristics as [List.keepIf].
## See its documentation for details on those characteristics!
dropIf : List elem, (elem -> Bool) -> List elem

## Access

## Returns the first element in the list, or `ListWasEmpty` if it was empty.
first : List elem -> Result elem [ ListWasEmpty ]*

## Returns the last element in the list, or `ListWasEmpty` if it was empty.
last : List elem -> Result elem [ ListWasEmpty ]*

get : List elem, Nat -> Result elem [ OutOfBounds ]*

max : List (Num a) -> Result (Num a) [ ListWasEmpty ]*

min : List (Num a) -> Result (Num a) [ ListWasEmpty ]*

## Modify

## Replaces the element at the given index with a replacement.
##
## >>> List.set [ "a", "b", "c" ] 1 "B"
##
## If the given index is outside the bounds of the list, returns the original
## list unmodified.
##
## To drop the element at a given index, instead of replacing it, see [List.dropAt].
set : List elem, Nat, elem -> List elem

## Drops n elements from the beginning of the list.
drop : List elem, Nat -> List elem

## Drops the element at the given index from the list.
##
## This has no effect if the given index is outside the bounds of the list.
##
## To replace the element at a given index, instead of dropping it, see [List.set].
dropAt : List elem, Nat -> List elem

## Adds a new element to the end of the list.
##
## >>> List.append [ "a", "b" ] "c"
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## When given a Unique list, this adds the new element in-place if possible.
## This is only possible if the list has enough capacity. Otherwise, it will
## have to *clone and grow*. See the section on [capacity](#capacity) in this
## module's documentation.
append : List elem, elem -> List elem

## Adds a new element to the beginning of the list.
##
## >>> List.prepend [ "b", "c" ] "a"
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## This always clones the entire list, even when given a Unique list. That means
## it runs about as fast as `List.addLast` when both are given a Shared list.
##
## If you have a Unique list instead, [List.append] will run much faster than
## [List.append] except in the specific case where the list has no excess capacity,
## and needs to *clone and grow*. In that uncommon case, both [List.append] and
## [List.append] will run at about the same speed—since [List.append] always
## has to clone and grow.
##
##         | Unique list                    | Shared list    |
##---------+--------------------------------+----------------+
## append  | in-place given enough capacity | clone and grow |
## prepend | clone and grow                 | clone and grow |
prepend : List elem, elem -> List elem

## Remove the last element from the list.
##
## Returns both the removed element as well as the new list (with the removed
## element missing), or `Err ListWasEmpty` if the list was empty.
##
## Here's one way you can use this:
##
##     when List.pop list is
##         Ok { others, last } -> ...
##         Err ListWasEmpty -> ...
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## Calling `List.pop` on a Unique list runs extremely fast. It's essentially
## the same as a [List.last] except it also returns the [List] it was given,
## with its length decreased by 1.
##
## In contrast, calling `List.pop` on a Shared list creates a new list, then
## copies over every element in the original list except the last one. This
## takes much longer.
dropLast : List elem -> Result { others : List elem, last : elem } [ ListWasEmpty ]*

##
## Here's one way you can use this:
##
##     when List.pop list is
##         Ok { others, last } -> ...
##         Err ListWasEmpty -> ...
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## When calling either `List.dropFirst` or `List.dropLast` on a Unique list, `List.dropLast`
## runs *much* faster. This is because for `List.dropLast`, removing the last element
## in-place is as easy as reducing the length of the list by 1. In contrast,
## removing the first element from the list involves copying every other element
## in the list into the index before it - which is massively more costly.
##
## In the case of a Shared list,
##
##           | Unique list                      | Shared list                     |
##-----------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------+
## dropFirst | [List.last] + length change       | [List.last] + clone rest of list |
## dropLast  | [List.last] + clone rest of list  | [List.last] + clone rest of list |
dropFirst : List elem -> Result { first: elem, others : List elem } [ ListWasEmpty ]*

## Returns the given number of elements from the beginning of the list.
##
## >>> List.takeFirst 4 [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
##
## If there are fewer elements in the list than the requested number,
## returns the entire list.
##
## >>> List.takeFirst 5 [ 1, 2 ]
##
## To *remove* elements from the beginning of the list, use `List.takeLast`.
##
## To remove elements from both the beginning and end of the list,
## use `List.sublist`.
##
## To split the list into two lists, use `List.split`.
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## When given a Unique list, this runs extremely fast. It sets the list's length
## to the given length value, and frees the leftover elements. This runs very
## slightly faster than `List.takeLast`.
##
## In fact, `List.takeFirst 1 list` runs faster than `List.first list` when given
## a Unique list, because [List.first] returns the first element as well -
## which introduces a conditional bounds check as well as a memory load.
takeFirst : List elem, Nat -> List elem

## Returns the given number of elements from the end of the list.
##
## >>> List.takeLast 4 [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
##
## If there are fewer elements in the list than the requested number,
## returns the entire list.
##
## >>> List.takeLast 5 [ 1, 2 ]
##
## To *remove* elements from the end of the list, use `List.takeFirst`.
##
## To remove elements from both the beginning and end of the list,
## use `List.sublist`.
##
## To split the list into two lists, use `List.split`.
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## When given a Unique list, this runs extremely fast. It moves the list's
## pointer to the index at the given length value, updates its length,
## and frees the leftover elements. This runs very nearly as fast as
## `List.takeFirst` on a Unique list.
##
## In fact, `List.takeLast 1 list` runs faster than `List.first list` when given
## a Unique list, because [List.first] returns the first element as well -
## which introduces a conditional bounds check as well as a memory load.
takeLast : List elem, Nat -> List elem

## Deconstruct

## Splits the list into two lists, around the given index.
##
## The returned lists are labeled `before` and `others`. The `before` list will
## contain all the elements whose index in the original list was **less than**
## than the given index, # and the `others` list will be all the others. (This
## means if you give an index of 0, the `before` list will be empty and the
## `others` list will have the same elements as the original list.)
split : List elem, Nat -> { before: List elem, others: List elem }

## Returns a subsection of the given list, beginning at the `start` index and
## including a total of `len` elements.
##
## If `start` is outside the bounds of the given list, returns the empty list.
##
## >>> List.sublist { start: 4, len: 0 } [ 1, 2, 3 ]
##
## If more elements are requested than exist in the list, returns as many as it can.
##
## >>> List.sublist { start: 2, len: 10 } [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
##
## > If you want a sublist which goes all the way to the end of the list, no
## > matter how long the list is, `List.takeLast` can do that more efficiently.
##
## Some languages have a function called **`slice`** which works similarly to this.
sublist : List elem, { start : Nat, len : Nat } -> List elem

## Build a value using each element in the list.
##
## Starting with a given `state` value, this walks through each element in the
## list from first to last, running a given `step` function on that element
## which updates the `state`. It returns the final `state` at the end.
##
## You can use it in a pipeline:
##
##     [ 2, 4, 8 ]
##         |> List.walk { start: 0, step: Num.add }
##
## This returns 14 because:
## * `state` starts at 0 (because of `start: 0`)
## * Each `step` runs `Num.add state elem`, and the return value becomes the new `state`.
##
## Here is a table of how `state` changes as [List.walk] walks over the elements
## `[ 2, 4, 8 ]` using #Num.add as its `step` function to determine the next `state`.
##
## `state` | `elem` | `step state elem` (`Num.add state elem`)
## --------+--------+-----------------------------------------

## So `state` goes through these changes:
## 1. `0` (because of `start: 0`)
## 2. `1` (because of `Num.add state elem` with `state` = 0 and `elem` = 1

##     [ 1, 2, 3 ]
##         |> List.walk { start: 0, step: Num.sub }

walkBackwards : List elem, state, (state, elem -> state) -> state

## Same as [List.walk], except you can stop walking early.
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## Compared to [List.walk], this can potentially visit fewer elements (which can
## improve performance) at the cost of making each step take longer.
## However, the added cost to each step is extremely small, and can easily
## be outweighed if it results in skipping even a small number of elements.
##
## As such, it is typically better for performance to use this over [List.walk]
## if returning `Done` earlier than the last element is expected to be common.
walkUntil : List elem, state, (state, elem -> [ Continue state, Done state ]) -> state

# Same as [List.walk]Backwards, except you can stop walking early.
walkBackwardsUntil : List elem, state, (state, elem -> [ Continue state, Done state ]) -> state

## Check

## Returns the length of the list - the number of elements it contains.
##
## One [List] can store up to 2,147,483,648 elements (just over 2 billion), which
## is exactly equal to the highest valid #I32 value. This means the #U32 this function
## returns can always be safely converted to an #I32 without losing any data.
