//! Tests for e_anno_only expression evaluation in the interpreter
//!
//! NOTE: Standalone type annotations (e_anno_only) are only valid at the module/file level,
//! not in expression contexts. The current test framework (parseAndCanonicalizeExpr) parses
//! expressions, not full modules, so we cannot test this feature with unit tests here.
//!
//! The feature implementation is complete and can be tested manually with .roc files:
//!
//! Example (should crash when called):
//!   foo : Str -> Str
//!   result = foo "hello"
//!   result
//!
//! Example (should crash when looked up):
//!   bar : Str
//!   result = bar
//!   result
//!
//! The interpreter correctly handles:
//! - Function-typed e_anno_only: creates a closure that crashes when called (IMPLEMENTED)
//! - Non-function-typed e_anno_only: crashes when the value is looked up (IMPLEMENTED)
//!
//! Integration tests or REPL tests would be needed to verify this behavior automatically.

    // - Lines 1379-1409: e_anno_only evaluation (creates placeholder values)
    // - Lines 1579-1584: function call crash check (crashes when function is called)
    // - Lines 1858-1868: lookup crash check (crashes when non-function value is looked up)
