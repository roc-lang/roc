# Eval

Runtime evaluation and interpretation system for executing Roc programs during compilation.

The eval module is the fourth stage of the Roc compiler pipeline, responsible for interpreting and executing Roc programs. It provides a fast development experience by allowing code to run immediately after type checking, without needing to go through the full compilation and linking process.

## Validation and Testing

The primary method for validating eval behavior is through **REPL snapshots**. These are comprehensive integration tests that capture the complete evaluation pipeline from source code to final output.

#### Running REPL Snapshots

Run all REPL snapshots to check for any changes in expected output:
```bash
zig build snapshot
```

Run a specific REPL snapshot with trace evaluation for debugging:
```bash
zig build snapshot -- --trace-eval src/snapshots/repl/your_test.md
```

#### REPL Snapshot Format

REPL snapshots are markdown files with a specific structure:

```markdown
# META
~~~ini
description=your description here
type=repl
~~~
# SOURCE

» 0.1 + 0.2

#### Creating New REPL Snapshots

1. Create a new `.md` file in `src/snapshots/repl/`
2. Add your test cases in the SOURCE section
3. Run `zig build snapshot` to generate expected outputs
4. Use `--trace-eval` for debugging specific scenarios
