//! The stack (as in stack memory) used when evaluating Roc IR.
//!
//! This has a lot in common with a thread's stack memory: it's fixed-size, bumps a
//! pointer to allocate, and can pop. But this stack's memory comes from an Allocator.
//!
//! When a scope begins, we write down the current stack pointer (at runtime), and then
//! proceed with letting things do `stack.alloca()` as often as necessary. Then, when
//! that scope ends, we reset the stack back to where it was when the scope began,
//! and everything is effectively wiped out.
//!
//! When it's a function being called, or an expression that's going to evaluate to
//! a value that has its own scope (e.g. `x = { ... }`), it's the job of the caller
//! (or the code preceding the expression) to allocate enough space for the return value
//! before entering the scope, and to hand a pointer to that space to the scope (or function).
//! That way, the return value can be written to a location where the caller can access it
//! even after the stack has been reset due to the scope ending.
