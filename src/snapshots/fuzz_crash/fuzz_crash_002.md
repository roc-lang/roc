# PROBLEMS
**MISSING HEADER**
Roc files must start with a module header.

For example:
        module [main]
or for an app:
        app [main!] { pf: platform "../basic-cli/platform.roc" }

Here is the problematic code:
**fuzz_crash_002.md:1:1:1:6:**
```roc
modu:;::::::::::::::le[%
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **:;** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**fuzz_crash_002.md:1:5:1:7:**
```roc
modu:;::::::::::::::le[%
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
