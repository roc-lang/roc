# PROBLEMS
**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **, 3** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**list_double_comma.md:1:8:1:11:**
```roc
[1, 2, , 3]
```
       ^^^


**LIST NOT CLOSED**
This list is missing a closing bracket or has a syntax error.
Lists must be closed with **]** and list items must be separated by commas.
For example:     [1, 2, 3]

Here is the problematic code:
**list_double_comma.md:1:11:1:12:**
```roc
[1, 2, , 3]
```
