# EXPECTED
EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED - package_header_nonempty_multiline_1.md:2:3:2:12
# PROBLEMS
**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that ``something`` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**package_header_nonempty_multiline_1.md:2:3:2:12:**
```roc
	[something, SomeType]
```
  ^^^^^^^^^
You can fix this by either defining ``something`` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.

**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that ``SomeType`` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**package_header_nonempty_multiline_1.md:2:14:2:22:**
```roc
	[something, SomeType]
```
             ^^^^^^^^
You can fix this by either defining ``SomeType`` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.
