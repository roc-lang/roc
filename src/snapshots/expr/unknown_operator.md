# PROBLEMS
**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **+ 2** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**unknown_operator.md:1:4:1:7:**
```roc
1 ++ 2
```
   ^^^


**UNKNOWN OPERATOR**
This looks like an operator, but it's not one I recognize!
Check the spelling and make sure you're using a valid Roc operator.
