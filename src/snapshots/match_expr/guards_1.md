**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named `value` in this scope.
Is there an `import` or `exposing` missing up-top?

**guards_1.md:1:7:1:12:**
```roc
match value {
```
      ^^^^^


**UNKNOWN OPERATOR**
This looks like an operator, but it's not one I recognize!

**guards_1.md:2:19:2:20:**
```roc
    x if x > 0 => "positive: ${Num.toStr x}"
```
                  ^

Check the spelling and make sure you're using a valid Roc operator like `+`, `-`, `==`.

**UNUSED VARIABLE**
Variable `x` is not used anywhere in your code.

If you don't need this variable, prefix it with an underscore like `_x` to suppress this warning.
The unused variable is declared here:
**guards_1.md:2:5:2:6:**
```roc
    x if x > 0 => "positive: ${Num.toStr x}"
```
    ^
