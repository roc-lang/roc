# PROBLEMS
**MISSING HEADER**
Roc files must start with a module header.

For example:
        module [main]
or for an app:
        app [main!] { pf: platform "../basic-cli/platform.roc" }

Here is the problematic code:
**statement_record_destructure.md:1:1:1:7:**
```roc
{ name, age, email } = person
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **, age** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**statement_record_destructure.md:1:7:1:12:**
```roc
{ name, age, email } = person
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **, email** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**statement_record_destructure.md:1:12:1:19:**
```roc
{ name, age, email } = person
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **} =** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**statement_record_destructure.md:1:20:1:23:**
```roc
{ name, age, email } = person
```


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **= person** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

Here is the problematic code:
**statement_record_destructure.md:1:22:1:30:**
```roc
{ name, age, email } = person
```
