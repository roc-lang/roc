# FS

File system utilities and abstractions for the Roc compiler.

## Overview

The fs module provides cross-platform file system operations and abstractions that the Roc compiler needs for reading source files, managing build artifacts, and handling file-based operations.

## Purpose

This module provides:
- **File Operations**: Reading, writing, and managing files across different platforms
- **Path Handling**: Cross-platform path manipulation and normalization
- **Directory Operations**: Creating, listing, and managing directories
- **File Watching**: Monitoring file changes for incremental compilation
- **Platform Abstraction**: Unified interface for different operating systems
