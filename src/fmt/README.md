# Fmt

This directory contains the implementation of the `roc fmt` command, the code formatter for the Roc language.

Its primary purpose is to format `.roc` source files with a consistent and deterministic style.

While this module is currently only used by the `roc` CLI, it is designed to be reusable so that it can be integrated into other tools in the future.
