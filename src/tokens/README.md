# Tokens

This module converts Roc source code into a flat stream of tokens.

## Purpose

Tokenization is the first stage of the Roc compiler pipeline, transforming raw source code bytes into a more structured representation that can be processed by subsequent stages (parsing, canonicalization, type checking, etc.).
