# Parse

Converts Roc source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) through tokenization and parsing.

## Purpose

The parse module is the first stage of the Roc compiler pipeline, transforming raw source code into a structured representation that can be processed by subsequent stages (canonicalization, type checking, etc.).
