# AST

This module parses a flat stream of tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Purpose

Parsing is the second stage of the Roc compiler pipeline, transforming a flat stream of tokens into a tree structure that can be processed by subsequent stages (canonicalization, type checking, etc.).
