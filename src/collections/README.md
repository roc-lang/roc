# Collections

The collections module provides efficient data structures that are tailored for use throughout the Roc compiler. These collections are designed to handle the specific needs of compiler operations like symbol tables, dependency graphs, and intermediate representations.

## Purpose

This module provides:
- **Specialized Data Structures**: Collections optimized for compiler-specific use cases
- **Memory Efficiency**: Data structures designed to minimize memory overhead during compilation
- **Performance**: Fast access patterns for common compiler operations
- **Type Safety**: Safe, generic collections that work with Roc's type system
