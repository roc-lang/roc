//! This module defines the core data structures for representing types in the compiler's
//! Hindley-Milner type inference system. It includes:
//!
//! - `Var`: unique type variable identifiers
//! - `Descriptor`: the rank, mark, and structure of a type
//! - `Content`: the semantic meaning of a type (flex var, alias, function, record, etc.)
//! - `FlatType`: the 'flat' shape of a type (tuples, numbers, tag unions, etc.)
//! - `Alias`: nominal or structural type aliases
//! - `Func`, `Record`, `TagUnion`: structured type forms
//!
//! Special care is taken to keep memory layouts small and efficient. When modifying
//! these types, please consider their size impact and unification performance.
