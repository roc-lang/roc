# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Make sure to take a look at the [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md)!

## How to contribute

All contributions are appreciated! Typo fixes, bug fixes, feature requests,
bug reports are all helpful for the project.

If you are looking for a good place to start, consider reaching out on the `#contributing` channel on [Roc Zulip][roc-zulip].
Before making your first pull request, definitely talk to an existing contributor on [Roc Zulip][roc-zulip] first about what you plan to do! This can not only avoid duplicated effort, it can also avoid making a whole PR only to discover it won't be accepted because the change doesn't fit with the goals of the language's design or implementation.

If you are interested in larger, implementation- or research-heavy projects
related to Roc, check out [Roc Project Ideas][project-ideas] and reach out to us
on Zulip! These projects may be suitable for academic theses, independent
research, or even just valuable projects to learn from and improve Roc with.

## Building from Source

Check [Building from source](BUILDING_FROM_SOURCE.md) for instructions.

## Running Tests

Most contributors execute the following commands befor pushing their code:

```sh
cargo test
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --tests -- --deny warnings
```

Execute `cargo fmt --all` to fix the formatting.

## Contribution Tips

- If you've never made a pull request on github before, [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) will be a good place to start.
- Create an issue if the purpose of a struct/field/type/function/... is not immediately clear from its name or nearby comments.
- You can find good first issues [here][good-first-issues].
- [Fork](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/fork) the repo so that you can apply your changes first on your own copy of the roc repo.
- It's a good idea to open a draft pull request as you begin working on something. This way, others can see that you're working on it, which avoids duplicate effort, and others can give feedback sooner rather than later if they notice a problem in the direction things are going. Click the button "ready for review" when it's ready.
- All your commits need to be signed to prevent impersonation:
  1. If you have a Yubikey, follow [guide 1](https://dev.to/paulmicheli/using-your-yubikey-to-get-started-with-gpg-3h4k), [guide 2](https://dev.to/paulmicheli/using-your-yubikey-for-signed-git-commits-4l73) and skip the steps below.
  2. [Make a key to sign your commits.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key).
  3. [Configure git to use your key.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)
  4. Make git sign your commits automatically:

   ```sh
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```
