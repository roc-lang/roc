INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS - let_polymorphism_error.md:1:6:1:6
# PROBLEMS
**INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS**
The second and third elements in this list have incompatible types:
**let_polymorphism_error.md:1:6:**
```roc
[42, 4.2, "hello"]
```
     ^^^  ^^^^^^^

The second element has this type:
    _Num(Frac(_size))_

However, the third element has this type:
    _Str_

All elements in a list must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap each element in a tag to make them compatible.
To learn about tags, see <https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tags>
