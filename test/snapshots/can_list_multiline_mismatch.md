INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS - can_list_multiline_mismatch.md:2:5:2:5
# PROBLEMS
**INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS**
The first two elements in this list have incompatible types:
**can_list_multiline_mismatch.md:2:5:**
```roc
    42,
    "hello world",
```
    ^^
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first element has this type:
    _Num(_size)_

However, the second element has this type:
    _Str_

All elements in a list must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap each element in a tag to make them compatible.
To learn about tags, see <https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tags>
