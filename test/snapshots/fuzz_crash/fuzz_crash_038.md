# PROBLEMS
**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **<unknown>** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.



**UNSUPPORTED NODE**
This syntax is not yet supported by the compiler.
This might be a limitation in the current implementation that will be addressed in a future update.
