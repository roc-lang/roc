**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **'** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

**fuzz_crash_031.md:4:10:4:11:**
```roc
vavar t= '
```
         ^


**EXPRESSION IN STATEMENT CONTEXT**
Found an expression where a statement was expected.
This might be a missing semicolon or an incorrectly placed expression.

**fuzz_crash_031.md:1:1:1:5:**
```roc
mule []
```
^^^^


**UNSUPPORTED NODE**
This syntax is not yet supported by the compiler.
This might be a limitation in the current implementation that will be addressed in a future update.
