# PROBLEMS
**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named `x` in this scope.
Is there an `import` or `exposing` missing up-top?

**pattern_f64_overflow.md:1:7:1:8:**
```roc
match x {
```
      ^


**F64 NOT ALLOWED IN PATTERN**
This floating-point literal cannot be used in a pattern match: `1e100`

This number exceeds the precision range of Roc's `Dec` type and would require F64 representation. Floating-point numbers (F64) cannot be used in patterns because they don't have reliable equality comparison.

Consider one of these alternatives:
• Use a guard condition with a range check
• Use a smaller number that fits in Dec's precision
• Restructure your code to avoid pattern matching on this value

For example, instead of:
`1e100 => ...`
Use a guard:
`n if n > 1e99 => ...`

**F64 NOT ALLOWED IN PATTERN**
This floating-point literal cannot be used in a pattern match: `1e-40`

This number exceeds the precision range of Roc's `Dec` type and would require F64 representation. Floating-point numbers (F64) cannot be used in patterns because they don't have reliable equality comparison.

Consider one of these alternatives:
• Use a guard condition with a range check
• Use a smaller number that fits in Dec's precision
• Restructure your code to avoid pattern matching on this value

For example, instead of:
`1e100 => ...`
Use a guard:
`n if n > 1e99 => ...`

**F64 NOT ALLOWED IN PATTERN**

**UNUSED VARIABLE**
Variable `value` is not used anywhere in your code.

If you don't need this variable, prefix it with an underscore like `_value` to suppress this warning.
The unused variable is declared here:
**pattern_f64_overflow.md:6:5:6:10:**
```roc
    value => "other"
```
