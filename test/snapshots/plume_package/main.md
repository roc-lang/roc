# PROBLEMS
**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `Color` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**main.md:2:5:2:10:**
```roc
    Color,
```
    ^^^^^
You can fix this by either defining `Color` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.
