**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **Bool.true** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**block_with_assignments.md:5:16:5:25:**
```roc
    isActive = Bool.true
```
               ^^^^^^^^^


**TYPE IN EXPRESSION CONTEXT**
Found a type annotation where an expression was expected.
Type annotations should appear after a colon in declarations, not in expression contexts.

**block_with_assignments.md:8:16:8:23:**
```roc
    record = { age: 30, city: "NYC" }
```
               ^^^^^^^
