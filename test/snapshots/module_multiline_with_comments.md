# PROBLEMS
**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `something` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**module_multiline_with_comments.md:3:3:3:12:**
```roc
		something, # Comment after exposed item
```
  ^^^^^^^^^
You can fix this by either defining `something` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.

**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `SomeType` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**module_multiline_with_comments.md:4:3:4:11:**
```roc
		SomeType, # Comment after final exposed item
```
  ^^^^^^^^
You can fix this by either defining `SomeType` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.
