INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS - can_list_mismatch_then_nested_error.md:1:15:1:15
# PROBLEMS
**INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS**
The first two elements in this list have incompatible types:
**can_list_mismatch_then_nested_error.md:1:2:**
```roc
[1, "hello", [3, "world"]]
```
 ^  ^^^^^^^

The first element has this type:
    _Num(_size)_

However, the second element has this type:
    _Str_

All elements in a list must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap each element in a tag to make them compatible.
To learn about tags, see <https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tags>
