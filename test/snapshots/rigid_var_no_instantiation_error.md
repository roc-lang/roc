# PROBLEMS
**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **Bool.true** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**rigid_var_no_instantiation_error.md:17:21:17:30:**
```roc
    result2 = swap((Bool.true, [1, 2, 3]))
```
                    ^^^^^^^^^


**UNUSED VARIABLE**
Variable **result1** is not used anywhere in your code.

If you don't need this variable, prefix it with an underscore like `_result1` to suppress this warning.
The unused variable is declared here:

**rigid_var_no_instantiation_error.md:13:5:13:12:**
```roc
    result1 = swap((42, "hello"))
```
    ^^^^^^^


**UNUSED VARIABLE**
Variable **result2** is not used anywhere in your code.

If you don't need this variable, prefix it with an underscore like `_result2` to suppress this warning.
The unused variable is declared here:

**rigid_var_no_instantiation_error.md:17:5:17:12:**
```roc
    result2 = swap((Bool.true, [1, 2, 3]))
```
    ^^^^^^^


**UNUSED VARIABLE**
Variable **result3** is not used anywhere in your code.

If you don't need this variable, prefix it with an underscore like `_result3` to suppress this warning.
The unused variable is declared here:

**rigid_var_no_instantiation_error.md:21:5:21:12:**
```roc
    result3 = swap(("foo", "bar"))
```
    ^^^^^^^
