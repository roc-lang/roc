# PROBLEMS
**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **list** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**list_destructure_scoping.md:1:7:1:11:**
```roc
match list {
```
      ^^^^


**UNSUPPORTED NODE**
This syntax is not yet supported by the compiler.
This might be a limitation in the current implementation that will be addressed in a future update.

**list_destructure_scoping.md:2:5:3:38:**
```roc
    [first] => first
    [first, second] => first + second
```
