# EXPECTED
UNDEFINED VARIABLE - middle_rest.md:1:7:1:12
UNUSED VARIABLE - middle_rest.md:1:1:1:1
# PROBLEMS
**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **as ** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

**middle_rest.md:3:15:3:18:**
```roc
    [a, b, .. as middle, x, y] => a + b + x + y  
```
              ^^^


**LIST NOT CLOSED**
This list is not properly closed.
Expected either a comma **,** to continue the list or a closing bracket **]** to end it.

**middle_rest.md:3:5:3:18:**
```roc
    [a, b, .. as middle, x, y] => a + b + x + y  
```
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**UNEXPECTED TOKEN IN EXPRESSION**
The token **] ** is not expected in an expression.
Expressions can be identifiers, literals, function calls, or operators.

**middle_rest.md:3:30:3:32:**
```roc
    [a, b, .. as middle, x, y] => a + b + x + y  
```
                             ^^


**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **items** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**middle_rest.md:1:7:1:12:**
```roc
match items {
```
      ^^^^^


**UNSUPPORTED NODE**
This syntax is not yet supported by the compiler.
This might be a limitation in the current implementation that will be addressed in a future update.

**middle_rest.md:2:13:2:15:**
```roc
    [first, .., last] => first + last
```
            ^^


**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **a** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**middle_rest.md:3:6:3:7:**

```
     ^


**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **b** in this scope.
Is there an **import** or **exposing** missing up-top?

**middle_rest.md:3:9:3:10:**

**UNDEFINED VARIABLE**
Nothing is named **x** in this scope.
