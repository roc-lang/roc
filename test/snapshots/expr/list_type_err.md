INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS - list_type_err.md:1:5:1:5
# PROBLEMS
**INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS**
The second and third elements in this list have incompatible types:
**list_type_err.md:1:5:**
```roc
[1, 2, "hello"]
```
    ^  ^^^^^^^

The second element has this type:
    _Num(_size)_

However, the third element has this type:
    _Str_

All elements in a list must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap each element in a tag to make them compatible.
To learn about tags, see <https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tags>
