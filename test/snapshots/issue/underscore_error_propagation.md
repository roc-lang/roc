# PROBLEMS
**UNDERSCORE IN TYPE ALIAS**
Underscores are not allowed in type alias declarations.

**underscore_error_propagation.md:1:1:1:1:**
```roc
BadBase := _
```
^

Underscores in type annotations mean "I don't care about this type", which doesn't make sense when declaring a type. If you need a placeholder type variable, use a named type variable like `a` instead.

**TYPE MISMATCH**
This expression is used in an unexpected way:
**underscore_error_propagation.md:6:9:6:15:**
```roc
value = "test"
```
        ^^^^^^

It has the type:
    _Str_

But the type annotation says it should have the type:
    _BadDerived_

**TYPE MISMATCH**
This expression is used in an unexpected way:
**underscore_error_propagation.md:13:13:13:19:**
```roc
goodValue = "test"
```
            ^^^^^^

It has the type:
    _Str_

But the type annotation says it should have the type:
    _GoodDerived_
