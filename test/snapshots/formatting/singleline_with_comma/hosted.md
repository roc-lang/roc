# PROBLEMS
**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `a!` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**hosted.md:1:9:1:11:**
```roc
hosted [a!, b!,]
```
        ^^
You can fix this by either defining `a!` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.

**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `b!` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**hosted.md:1:13:1:15:**
```roc
hosted [a!, b!,]
```
            ^^
You can fix this by either defining `b!` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.
