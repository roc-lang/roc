# Name and Logo

The Roc programming language is named after [a mythical bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)).

That‚Äôs why the logo is a bird. It‚Äôs specifically an [*origami* bird](https://youtu.be/9gni1t1k1uY) as a homage
to [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)‚Äôs tangram logo.

Roc is a direct descendant of Elm. The languages are similar, but not the same.
[Origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami) likewise has similarities to [tangrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram), although they are not the same. 
Both involve making a surprising variety of things 
from simple primitives. [*Folds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) 
are also common in functional programming.

The logo was made by tracing triangles onto a photo of a physical origami bird. 
It‚Äôs made of triangles because triangles are a foundational primitive in 
computer graphics.

The name was chosen because it makes for a three-letter file extension, it means 
something fantastical, and it has incredible potential for puns.
