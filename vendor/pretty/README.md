Pretty printing combinators for Rust

## Synopsis

This crate provides functionality for defining pretty printers. It is
particularly useful for printing structured recursive data like trees.

The implementation was originally based on Larsen's SML translation
(<https://github.com/kfl/wpp>) of Wadler's Haskell pretty printer
(<https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf>). It
has since been modified in various ways to better fit Rust's
programming model. In particular, it uses iteration rather than
recursion and provides streaming output.

## Documentation

See the generated API documentation [here](https://docs.rs/pretty).

## Requirements

1. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. [Cargo](https://crates.io/)

You can install both with the following:

```
curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh
```

See [Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) for further details.

## Usage

```
cargo build                                          ## build library and binary
cargo run --example trees                            ## run the example (pretty trees)
cargo run --example colored --features termcolor     ## run the example (pretty colored output)
cargo bench                                          ## run benchmarks
cargo test                                           ## run tests
```
