// Each page has 128 slots. Each slot holds one 32B node
// This means each page is 4096B, which is the size of a memory page
// on typical systems where the compiler will be run.
//
// Nice things about this system include:
// * Allocating a new page is as simple as asking the OS for a memory page.
// * Since each node is 32B, each node's memory address will be a multiple of 16.
// * Thanks to the free lists and our consistent chunk sizes, we should
//   end up with very little fragmentation.
// * Finding a slot for a given node should be very fast: see if the relevant
//   free list has any openings; if not, try the next size up.
//
// Less nice things include:
// * This system makes it very hard to ever give a page back to the OS.
//   We could try doing the Mesh Allocator strategy: whenever we allocate
//   something, assign it to a random slot in the page, and then periodically
//   try to merge two pages into one (by locking and remapping them in the OS)
//   and then returning the redundant physical page back to the OS. This should
//   work in theory, but is pretty complicated, and we'd need to schedule it.
//   Keep in mind that we can't use the Mesh Allocator itself because it returns
//   usize pointers, which would be too big for us to have 16B nodes.
//   On the plus side, we could be okay with higher memory usage early on,
//   and then later use the Mesh strategy to reduce long-running memory usage.
//
// With this system, we can allocate up to 4B nodes. If we wanted to keep
// a generational index in there, like https://crates.io/crates/sharded-slab
// does, we could use some of the 32 bits for that. For example, if we wanted
// to have a 5-bit generational index (supporting up to 32 generations), then
// we would have 27 bits remaining, meaning we could only support at most
// 134M nodes. Since the editor has a separate Pool for each module, is that
// enough for any single module we'll encounter in practice? Probably, and
// especially if we allocate super large collection literals on the heap instead
// of in the pool.
//
// Another possible design is to try to catch reuse bugs using an "ASan" like
// approach: in development builds, whenever we "free" a particular slot, we
// can add it to a dev-build-only "freed nodes" list and don't hand it back
// out (so, we leak the memory.) Then we can (again, in development builds only)
// check to see if we're about to store something in zeroed-out memory; if so, check
// to see if it was
