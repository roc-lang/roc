//! To avoid duplicating derived implementations for the same type, derived implementations are
//! addressed by a key of their type content. However, different derived implementations can be
//! reused based on different properties of the type. For example:
//!
//! - `Eq` does not care about surface type representations; its derived implementations can be
//!   uniquely addressed by the [`Layout`][crate::layout::Layout] of a type.
//! - `Encoding` must care about surface type representations; for example, `{ a: "" }` and
//!   `{ b: "" }` have different derived implementations. However, it does not need to distinguish
//!   between e.g. required and optional record fields.
//! - `Decoding` is like encoding, but has some differences. For one, it *does* need to distinguish
//!   between required and optional record fields.
//!
//! For these reasons the content keying is based on a strategy as well, which are the variants of
//! [`DeriveKey`].
