## A value that can hashed.
Hash has
    ## Hashes a value into a [Hasher].
    ## Note that [hash] does not produce a hash value itself; the hasher must be
    ## [complete]d in order to extract the hash value.
    hash : hasher, a -> hasher | a has Hash, hasher has Hasher

## Describes a hashing algorithm that is fed bytes and produces an integer hash.
##
## The [Hasher] ability describes general-purpose hashers. It only allows
## emission of 64-bit unsigned integer hashes. It is not suitable for
## cryptographically-secure hashing.
Hasher has
    ## Adds a list of bytes to the hasher.
    addBytes : a, List U8 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single U8 to the hasher.
    addU8 : a, U8 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single U16 to the hasher.
    addU16 : a, U16 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single U32 to the hasher.
    addU32 : a, U32 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single U64 to the hasher.
    addU64 : a, U64 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single U128 to the hasher.
    addU128 : a, U128 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single I8 to the hasher.
    addI8 : a, I8 -> a | a has Hasher

    ## Adds a single I16 to the hasher.

    ## Completes the hasher, extracting a hash value from its
    ## accumulated hash state.

## Adds a string into a [Hasher] by hashing its UTF-8 bytes.
