## ## Types
##
## A sequential list of values.
## ```roc
## [1, 2, 3] # a list of numbers
## ["a", "b", "c"] # a list of strings
## [[1.1], [], [2.2, 3.3]] # a list of lists of numbers
## ```
## The maximum size of a [List] is limited by the amount of heap memory available
## to the current process. If there is not enough memory available, attempting to
## create the list could crash. (On Linux, where [overcommit](https://www.etalabs.net/overcommit.html)
## is normally enabled, not having enough memory could result in the list appearing
## to be created just fine, but then crashing later.)
##
## > The theoretical maximum length for a list created in Roc is `Num.maxI32` on 32-bit systems
## > and `Num.maxI64` on 64-bit systems. Attempting to create a list bigger than that
## > in Roc code will always fail, although in practice it is likely to fail
## > at much smaller lengths due to insufficient memory being available.
##
## ## Performance Details
##
## Under the hood, a list is a record containing a `len : U64` field, a `capacity : U64`
## field, and a pointer to a reference count and a flat array of bytes.
##
## ## Shared Lists
##
## Shared lists are [reference counted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting).
##
## Each time a given list gets referenced, its reference count ("refcount" for short)
## gets incremented. Each time a list goes out of scope, its refcount count gets
## decremented. Once a refcount, has been decremented more times than it has been
## incremented, we know nothing is referencing it anymore, and the list's memory
## will be immediately freed.
##
## Let's look at an example.
## ```roc
## ratings = [5, 4, 3]
##
## { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
## ```
## The first line binds the name `ratings` to the list `[5, 4, 3]`. The list
## begins with a refcount of 1, because so far only `ratings` is referencing it.
##
## The second line alters this refcount. `{ foo: ratings` references
## the `ratings` list, and so does `bar: ratings }`. This will result in its
## refcount getting incremented from 1 to 3.
##
## Let's turn this example into a function.
## ```roc
## getRatings = \first ->
##     ratings = [first, 4, 3]
##
##     { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
##
## getRatings 5
## ```
## At the end of the `getRatings` function, when the record gets returned,
## the original `ratings =` binding has gone out of scope and is no longer
## accessible. (Trying to reference `ratings` outside the scope of the
## `getRatings` function would be an error!)
##
## Since `ratings` represented a way to reference the list, and that way is no
## longer accessible, the list's refcount gets decremented when `ratings` goes
## out of scope. It will decrease from 3 back down to 2.
##
## Putting these together, when we call `getRatings 5`, what we get back is
## a record with two fields, `foo`, and `bar`, each of which refers to the same
## list, and that list has a refcount of 2.
##
## Let's change the last line to be `(getRatings 5).bar` instead of `getRatings 5`:
## ```roc
## getRatings = \first ->
##     ratings = [first, 4, 3]
##
##     { foo: ratings, bar: ratings }
##
## (getRatings 5).bar
## ```
## Now, when this expression returns, only the `bar` field of the record will
## be returned. This will mean that the `foo` field becomes inaccessible, causing
## the list's refcount to get decremented from 2 to 1. At this point, the list is back
## where it started: there is only 1 reference to it.
##
## Finally let's suppose the final line were changed to this:
## ```roc
## List.first (getRatings 5).bar
## ```
## This call to [List.first] means that even the list in the `bar` field has become
## inaccessible. As such, this line will cause the list's refcount to get
## decremented all the way to 0. At that point, nothing is referencing the list
## anymore, and its memory will get freed.
##
## Things are different if this is a list of lists instead of a list of numbers.
## Let's look at a simpler example using [List.first] - first with a list of numbers,
## and then with a list of lists, to see how they differ.
##
## Here's the example using a list of numbers.
## ```roc
## nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
##
## first = List.first nums
## last = List.last nums
##
## first
## ```
## It makes a list, calls [List.first] and [List.last] on it, and then returns `first`.
##
## Here's the equivalent code with a list of lists:
## ```roc
## lists = [[1], [2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
##
## first = List.first lists
## last = List.last lists
##
## first
## ```
## **TODO** explain how in the former example, when we go to free `nums` at the end,
## we can free it immediately because there are no other refcounts. However,
## in the case of `lists`, we have to iterate through the list and decrement
## the refcounts of each of its contained lists - because they, too, have
## refcounts! Importantly, because the first element had its refcount incremented
## because the function returned `first`, that element will actually end up
## *not* getting freed at the end - but all the others will be.
##
## In the `lists` example, `lists = [...]` also creates a list with an initial
## refcount of 1. Separately, it also creates several other lists - each with
## their own refcounts - to go inside that list. (The empty list at the end
## does not use heap memory, and thus has no refcount.)
##
## At the end, we once again call [List.first] on the list, but this time
##
## * Copying small lists (64 elements or fewer) is typically slightly faster than copying small persistent data structures. This is because, at small sizes, persistent data structures tend to be thin wrappers around flat arrays anyway. They don't have any copying advantage until crossing a certain minimum size threshold.
## * Even when copying is faster, other list operations may still be slightly slower with persistent data structures. For example, even if it were a persistent data structure, [List.map], [List.walk], and [List.keepIf] would all need to traverse every element in the list and build up the result from scratch. These operations are all
## * Roc's compiler optimizes many list operations into in-place mutations behind the scenes, depending on how the list is being used. For example, [List.map], [List.keepIf], and [List.set] can all be optimized to perform in-place mutations.
## * If possible, it is usually best for performance to use large lists in a way where the optimizer can turn them into in-place mutations. If this is not possible, a persistent data structure might be faster - but this is a rare enough scenario that it would not be good for the average Roc program's performance if this were the way [List] worked by default. Instead, you can look outside Roc's standard modules for an implementation of a persistent data structure - likely built using [List] under the hood!

## Build a value using each element in the list.
##
## Starting with a given `state` value, this walks through each element in the
## list from first to last, running a given `step` function on that element
## which updates the `state`. It returns the final `state` at the end.
##
## You can use it in a pipeline:
## ```roc
## [2, 4, 8]
##     |> List.walk 0 Num.add
## ```
## This returns 14 because:
## * `state` starts at 0
## * Each `step` runs `Num.add state elem`, and the return value becomes the new `state`.
##
## Here is a table of how `state` changes as [List.walk] walks over the elements
## `[2, 4, 8]` using [Num.add] as its `step` function to determine the next `state`.
##
## state | elem  | Num.add state elem
## :---: | :---: | :----------------:
## 0     |       |
## 0     | 2     | 2
## 2     | 4     | 6
## 6     | 8     | 14
##
## The following returns -6:
## ```roc
## [1, 2, 3]
##     |> List.walk 0 Num.sub
## ```

## `fold`, `foldLeft`, or `foldl`.

## ## Performance Details
##
## Compared to [List.walk], this can potentially visit fewer elements (which can

## be outweighed if it results in skipping even a small number of elements.
##
## As such, it is typically better for performance to use this over [List.walk]

##

##
## (If you want to do an operation like this which reduces the memory footprint
## of the resulting list, you can do two passes over the list with [List.walk] - one

## Returns a list of all the integers between `start` and `end`.
##
## To include the `start` and `end` integers themselves, use `At` like so:
## ```roc
## List.range { start: At 2, end: At 5 } # returns [2, 3, 4, 5]
## ```
## To exclude them, use `After` and `Before`, like so:
## ```roc
## List.range { start: After 2, end: Before 5 } # returns [3, 4]
## ```
## You can have the list end at a certain length rather than a certain integer:
## ```roc
## List.range { start: At 6, end: Length 4 } # returns [6, 7, 8, 9]
## ```
## If `step` is specified, each integer increases by that much. (`step: 1` is the default.)
## ```roc
## List.range { start: After 0, end: Before 9, step: 3 } # returns [3, 6]
## ```
## List.range will also generate a reversed list if step is negative or end comes before start:
## ```roc
## List.range { start: At 5, end: At 2 } # returns [5, 4, 3, 2]
## ```
## All of these options are compatible with the others. For example, you can use `At` or `After`
## with `start` regardless of what `end` and `step` are set to.

## ## Performance Details
##
## Compared to [List.walk], this can potentially visit fewer elements (which can
## improve performance) at the cost of making each step take longer.
## However, the added cost to each step is extremely small, and can easily
## be outweighed if it results in skipping even a small number of elements.
##
## As such, it is typically better for performance to use this over [List.walk]
## if returning `Break` earlier than the last element is expected to be common.
