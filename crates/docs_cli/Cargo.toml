# This binary is only used on static build servers, e.g. Netlify.
# Having its own (extremely minimal) CLI means docs can be generated
# on a build server after building this crate from source, without
# having to install non-Rust dependencies (LLVM, Zig, wasm things, etc.)
# It gets called in www/build.sh via `cargo run --bin roc-docs`
