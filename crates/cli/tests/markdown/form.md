# A Simple Markdown Example

This file contains `form.roc` embedded as a block in Markdown. It lets us test that `roc check` works with Markdown.

```roc
module [foo]

foo = "Foo"
```

Excitingly, we can have another block of Roc code as well! (In this case it is the same one...)

```roc
module [bar]

bar = "Bar"
```
