# Examples

Took a look around in the `examples` folder, `examples/benchmarks` contains some larger examples.

Run examples as follows:
1. Navigate to `/examples`
2. Run with:
```
cargo run run hello-world/Hello.roc
```
Some examples like `examples/benchmarks/NQueens.roc` require input after running.
For NQueens, input 10 in the terminal and press enter.
