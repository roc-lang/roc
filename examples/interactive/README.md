# Interactive examples

These are examples of how to make basic CLI (command-line interface) and TUI (terminal user interface) apps in Roc.

The  platform is a work in progress, but you can look at [the docs for its modules](https://www.roc-lang.org/examples/cli/Http),
and [its source code](cli-platform) if you'd like to build your own CLI apps, perhaps using
the examples in this directory as starting points!

Feel free to ask [on Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com) in the `#beginners` channel if you have questions about making
CLI apps, or if there are operations you'd like to see added to this example CLI platform (for
an application you'd like to build in Roc).
