## You can canonicalize a [Path] using [Path.canonicalize].
##
## Comparing canonical paths is often more reliable than comparing raw ones.
## For example, `Path.fromStr "foo/bar/../baz" == Path.fromStr "foo/baz"` will return `Bool.false`,
## because those are different paths even though their canonical equivalents would be equal.
##
## Also note that canonicalization reads from the file system (in order to resolve symbolic
## links, and to convert relative paths into absolute ones). This means that it is not only
## a [Task] (which can fail), but also that running [canonicalize] on the same [Path] twice
## may give different answers. An example of a way this could happen is if a symbolic link
## in the path changed on disk to point somewhere else in between the two [canonicalize] calls.
##
## Similarly, remember that canonical paths are not guaranteed to refer to a valid file. They
## might have referred to one when they were canonicalized, but that file may have moved or
## been deleted since the canonical path was created. So you might [canonicalize] a [Path],
## and then immediately use that [Path] to read a file from disk, and still get back an error
## because something relevant changed on the filesystem between the two operations.
##
## Also note that different filesystems have different rules for syntactically valid paths.
## Suppose you're on a machine with two disks, one formatted as ext4 and another as FAT32.
## It's possible to list the contents of a directory on the ext4 disk, and get a [CanPath] which
## is valid on that disk, but invalid on the other disk. One way this could happen is if the
## directory on the ext4 disk has a filename containing a `:` in it. `:` is allowed in ext4
## paths but is considered invalid in FAT32 paths.
Path : InternalPath

CanonicalizeErr a : [
    PathCanonicalizeErr {},
]a

## Note that the path may not be valid depending on the filesystem where it is used.
## For example, paths containing `:` are valid on ext4 and NTFS filesystems, but not
## on FAT ones. So if you have multiple disks on the same machine, but they have
## different filesystems, then this path could be valid on one but invalid on another!
##
## It's safest to assume paths are invalid (even syntactically) until given to an operation
## which uses them to open a file. If that operation succeeds, then the path was valid
## (at the time). Otherwise, error handling can happen for that operation rather than validating
## up front for a false sense of security (given symlinks, parts of a path being renamed, etc.).
fromStr : Str -> Path
fromStr = \str ->
    FromStr str
    |> InternalPath.wrap

## Not all filesystems use Unicode paths. This function can be used to create a path which
## is not valid Unicode (like a Roc [Str] is), but which is valid for a particular filesystem.
##
## Note that if the list contains any `0` bytes, sending this path to any file operations
## (e.g. `File.read` or `WriteStream.openPath`) will fail.
fromBytes : List U8 -> Path
fromBytes = \bytes ->
    ArbitraryBytes bytes
    |> InternalPath.wrap

## Note that canonicalization reads from the file system (in order to resolve symbolic
## links, and to convert relative paths into absolute ones). This means that it is not only
## a [Task] (which can fail), but also that running [canonicalize] on the same [Path] twice
## may give different answers. An example of a way this could happen is if a symbolic link
## in the path changed on disk to point somewhere else in between the two [canonicalize] calls.
##
## Returns an effect type of `[Metadata, Cwd]` because it can resolve symbolic links
## and can access the current working directory by turning a relative path into an
## absolute one (which can prepend the absolute path of the current working directory to
## the relative path).
# canonicalize : Path -> Task Path (CanonicalizeErr *) [Metadata, Read [Env]]*
## Unfortunately, operating system paths do not include information about which charset
## they were originally encoded with. It's most common (but not guaranteed) that they will
## have been encoded with the same charset as the operating system's curent locale (which
## typically does not change after it is set during installation of the OS), so
## this should convert a [Path] to a valid string as long as the path was created
## with the given `Charset`. (Use `Env.charset` to get the current system charset.)
##
## For a conversion to [Str] that is lossy but does not return a [Result], see
## [display].
# toInner : Path -> [Str Str, Bytes (List U8)]
## Assumes a path is encoded as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8),
## and converts it to a string using `Str.display`.
##
## This conversion is lossy because the path may contain invalid UTF-8 bytes. If that happens,
## any invalid bytes will be replaced with the [Unicode replacement character](https://unicode.org/glossary/#replacement_character)
## instead of returning an error. As such, it's rarely a good idea to use the [Str] returned
## by this function for any purpose other than displaying it to a user.
##
## When you don't know for sure what a path's encoding is, UTF-8 is a popular guess because
## it's the default on UNIX and also is the encoding used in Roc strings. This platform also
## automatically runs applications under the [UTF-8 code page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page)
## on Windows.
##
## Converting paths to strings can be an unreliable operation, because operating systems
## don't record the paths' encodings. This means it's possible for the path to have been
## encoded with a different character set than UTF-8 even if UTF-8 is the system default,
## which means when [display] converts them to a string, the string may include gibberish.
## [Here is an example.](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/667652/can-a-file-path-be-invalid-utf-8/667863#667863)
##
## If you happen to know the `Charset` that was used to encode the path, you can use
## `toStrUsingCharset` instead of [display].
