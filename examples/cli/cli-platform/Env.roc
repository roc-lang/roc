## Reads the given environment variable and attempts to decode it.
##
## The type being decoded into will be determined by type inference. For example,
## if this ends up being used like a `Task U16 …` then the environment variable
## will be decoded as a string representation of a `U16`.

##     getU16Var : Str -> Task U16 [VarNotFound, DecodeErr DecodeError]* [Read [Env]*]*
##     getU16Var = \var -> Env.decode var
##     # If the environment contains a variable NUM_THINGS=123, then calling
##     # (getU16Var "NUM_THINGS") would return a task which succeeds with the U16 number 123.
##     #
##     # However, if the NUM_THINGS environment variable was set to 1234567, then
##     # (getU16Var "NUM_THINGS") would fail because that number is too big to fit in a U16.
##
## Supported types:
## - strings
## - numbers, as long as they contain only numeric digits, up to one `.`, and an optional `-` at the front for negative numbers
## - comma-separated lists (of either strings or numbers), as long as there are no spaces after the commas
##
## Trying to decode into any other types will always fail with a `DecodeErr`.

# TODO could potentially offer something like walkNonUnicode which takes (state, Result Str Str, Result Str Str) so it
# tells you when there's invalid Unicode. This is both faster than (and would give you more accurate info than)
# using regular `walk` and searching for the presence of the replacement character in the resulting
# strings. However, it's unclear whether anyone would use it. What would the use case be? Reporting
# an error that the provided command-line args weren't valid Unicode? Does that still happen these days?
# TODO need to figure out clear rules for how to convert from camelCase to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
# Note that all the env vars decoded in this way become effectively *required* vars, since if any
# of them are missing, decoding will fail. For this reason, it might make sense to use this to
# decode all the required vars only, and then decode the optional ones separately some other way.
# Alternatively, it could make sense to have some sort of tag union convention here, e.g.
# if decoding into a tag union of [Present val, Missing], then it knows what to do.
