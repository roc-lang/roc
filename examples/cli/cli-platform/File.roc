## Encodes a value using the given `EncodingFormat` and writes it to a file.
##
## For example, suppose you have a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
## `EncodingFormat` named `Json.toCompactUtf8`. Then you can use that format
## to write some encodable data to a file as JSON, like so:
##
##     File.write
##         (Path.fromStr "output.json")
##         { some: "json stuff" }
##         Json.toCompactUtf8
##     # Writes the following to the file `output.json`:
##     #
##     # {"some":"json stuff"}
##
## If writing to the file fails, for example because of a file permissions issue,
## the task fails with [WriteErr].
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
##
## To write unformatted bytes to a file, you can use [File.writeBytes] instead.

## Writes bytes to a file.
##
##     # Writes the bytes 1, 2, 3 to the file `myfile.dat`.
##     File.writeBytes (Path.fromStr "myfile.dat") [1, 2, 3]
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
##
## To format data before writing it to a file, you can use [File.write] instead.

## Writes a [Str] to a file, encoded as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
##
##     # Writes "Hello!" encoded as UTF-8 to the file `myfile.txt`.
##     File.writeUtf8 (Path.fromStr "myfile.txt") "Hello!"
##
## This opens the file first and closes it after writing to it.
##
## To write unformatted bytes to a file, you can use [File.writeBytes] instead.

## Deletes a file from the filesystem.
##
##     # Deletes the file named
##     File.delete (Path.fromStr "myfile.dat") [1, 2, 3]
##
## Note that this does not securely erase the file's contents from disk; instead, the operating
## system marks the space it was occupying as safe to write over in the future. Also, the operating
## system may not immediately mark the space as free; for example, on Windows it will wait until
## the last file handle to it is closed, and on UNIX, it will not remove it until the last
## [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) to it has been deleted.
##
## This performs a [`DeleteFile`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-deletefile)
## on Windows and [`unlink`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlink_(Unix)) on UNIX systems.
##
## On Windows, this will fail when attempting to delete a readonly file; the file's
## readonly permission must be disabled before it can be successfully deleted.
