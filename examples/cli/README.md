# Command Line Interface (CLI) Example

This is an example of how to make an extremely basic CLI in Roc.

There's not currently much documentation for the CLI platform (which also doesn't support many operations at this point!)
but you can look at [the modules it includes](platform) - for example,
multiple other modules use the [`Task`](platform/Task.roc) module, including the
[`Stdin`](platform/Stdin.roc) and [`Stdout`](platform/Stdout.roc) modules.
