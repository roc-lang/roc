# Install

Roc is a very young language with many incomplete features and known bugs. It doesn't even have a numbered release yet, but it does have [nightly builds](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/releases) that you can download, if you'd like to try it out without [building from source](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/BUILDING_FROM_SOURCE.md)! There are also [official Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/roclang) if you prefer to run Roc within a container.

There are currently a few known OS-specific issues:
* **macOS:** There are no known compatibility issues, but the compiler doesn't run as fast as it does on Linux or Windows, because we don't (yet) do our own linking like we do on those targets. (Linking works similarly on Linux and Windows, but the way macOS does it is both different and significantly more complicated.)
* **Windows:** There are some known Windows-specific compiler bugs, and probably some other unknown ones because more people have tried out Roc on Mac and Linux than on Windows.
* **Linux:** The nightlies are built with glibc, so they aren't usable on distros that don't use glibc, like Alpine. In the future we plan to build Linux releases with [musl libc](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/) to address this, but this requires [building LLVM from source with musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/building-llvm.html).
* **Other operating systems:** Roc has not been built on any other operating systems. [Building from source](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/BUILDING_FROM_SOURCE.md) on another OS might work, but you might very well be the first person ever to try it!
