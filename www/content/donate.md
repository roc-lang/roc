# Donate

We are a small group trying to do big things, and we are grateful for every donation! Right now we are trying to raise $4,000 USD/month in donations to fund one longtime Roc contributor to continue his work on Roc full-time.

You can donate to Roc's development using:
- [Every.org](https://www.every.org/roc-programming-language-foundation?donateTo=roc-programming-language-foundation) (supports credit card, bank, Venmo, PayPal, cryptocurrencies, and other options)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/roc_lang)
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/roc-lang)

All donations go through the [Roc Programming Language Foundation](https://foundation.roc-lang.org/), a registered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization">US <span class="nowrap">501(c)(3)</span> nonprofit organization</a>, which means these donations are tax-exempt in the US.

It also means that the foundation's tax filings are a [matter of public record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization#Transparency), so you have real transparency into how your donations are advancing Roc!

If you would like your organization to become an official sponsor of Roc's development, please [DM Richard Feldman on Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com/#narrow/pm-with/281383-user281383). We'd love to talk to you!
