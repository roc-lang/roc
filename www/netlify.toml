    # This style-src hash is to permit the <style> in the favicon so it looks good in both light and
    # dark mode. Favicons can only do this using inline <style> tags, so this exception is needed!
    #
    # When changing the favicon's <style>, generate a new hash and put it here using:
    #
    #   $ echo -n "polygon{fill:#7d59dd}@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark){polygon{fill:#9c7bea}}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64

    #
    # Also note that the sha256 in the script-src is for the <script> in the <head>
    # which removes the 'no-js' class. When changing it, use:
    #
    #   $ echo -n "document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace('no-js', '');" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
