<!--
In this section we want to explain the process, i.e. it's less formal

TODO finish editing this section
-->

Roc doesn't have a formal process for managing design proposals. The guiding principal for now is that as a community we should all be friendly, supportive, and openly discuss and sharing ideas.

There are three loose stages that a design proposal can go through in Roc: Idea, Proposal, and Implementation.

In the Idea stage, people are encouraged to describe their idea and explore the problem, potential solutions, and trade-offs. It is helpful to share the idea in the group chat using the #ideas channel.

If there is a general consensus that an idea is promising and worth developing, people are encouraged to develop a design Proposal. Some ideas are simple and should progress straight to implementation. However, for more complex Proposals a it write the design into an article or blog post and share it online. This documentation helps in clarifying the proposal and making it more accessible to the community.
