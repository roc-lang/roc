# Code of Conduct for the Roc GitHub Repository and Zulip Chat

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as participants in the Roc GitHub repository and Zulip Chat pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Kindly giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Telling others to be less sensitive, or that they should not feel hurt or offended by something

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior, including by project leaders or otherwise prominent community members.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. If a moderator is the subject of a reported code of conduct breach, or has a major conflict of interest, they should recuse themselves from participation in the resolution of that report. An exception to this is if more than 50% of the moderators would recuse themselves for the same reported breach; in such a case, none of them need to.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within the Roc GitHub repository as well as the Roc Zulip Chat. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official roc-lang.org e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as the project's appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by moderators.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@roc-lang.org](mailto:conduct@roc-lang.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The moderation team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of project leadership.
