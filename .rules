# Roc Compiler

This repository contains the source code for the Roc compiler -- both the original prototype written in Rust, and the new production version written in Zig.

All discussion, unless otherwise explicitly requested, is regarding the new Zig production version. Therefore, ONLY files under the `src/` directory should be considered moving forward.

## Documentation

Our approach is to review and update with each change. Quality documentation helps us understand quickly; however, this only works if we continuously improve and maintain it.

The documentation is aimed at our compiler engineers who only need high-level detail - they are comfortable using precise technical terminology. Therefore, our documentation should be concise, focusing on the WHY and avoiding the WHAT or HOW -- we shouldn't include implementation details as we expect these to change frequently.

Every `.zig` file should start with module documentation `//!` that describes the module's purpose.
Every `src/` directory should have a `README.md` file that describes the directory's purpose.

## Tests

Roc uses two different test strategies to Verify Correctness, and Validate Behaviour.
1. **Verify Correctness:** Where necessary, we add unit tests to ensure low-level or specific implementation details remain correct. These are written in `.zig` files using the `test` keyword alongside the code they are testing. These tests are typically limited in scope to a single function.
2. **Validate Behaviour:** More commonly, we add snapshot tests to provide assurance that the compiler continues to behave as expected. Snapshot files `.md` concurrently exercise many parts of the compiler by presenting the output of each stage for a given snippet of Roc code. Unlike unit tests, this has relevant debug-level information depth and multiple-compiler stage breadth.

### Usage

- **Run Unit Tests** `zig build test` (note `zig test` doesn't work as we have a complicated build system, therefore we use `zig build test` also for individual tests).
- **Generate or Update All Snapshots Files** `zig build snapshot`
- **Generate or Update Specific Snapshot File** `zig build snapshot -- <file_path>`
- **Update EXPECTED from PROBLEMS in Snapshot File** `zig build update-expected -- <file_path>`

### Snapshot File Structure

Each snapshot is a markdown file with the following key sections:

- **META**: Contains `description` and `type`. The `type` can be `file`, `expr`, `statement`, or `header`, depending on the scope of the test.
- **SOURCE**: The Roc code being tested.
- **EXPECTED**: Defines the expected outcome, which can be `NIL`, an error name, or specific output. This can be populated automatically using `zig build update-expected`.
- **Generated Sections**: The tool automatically generates sections like `TOKENS`, `PARSE`, `CANONICALIZE`, `TYPES`, and `PROBLEMS`.

### Best Practices for Creating Snapshots

1.  **Focused Intent**: Each snapshot should test a single, specific compiler behaviour. This is useful for new features, error cases, edge cases, and regression prevention.
2.  **Minimal Complexity**: Use the simplest possible code to demonstrate the behaviour you are testing. Consider using `...` ellipsis, which is valid syntax for "not implemented" and commonly used in examples.
3.  **Clear Naming**: The file name should clearly describe the test's purpose (e.g., `can_list_type_mismatch.md` is better than `test1.md`).

### Debugging with Snapshots

Snapshots are powerful for debugging as they show the compiler's output at every stage:
`SOURCE` -> `TOKENS` -> `PARSE` -> `CANONICALIZE` -> `TYPES`.

The `PROBLEMS` section provides human-readable diagnostics. When you modify the compiler, run `zig build snapshot` and review the diffs to ensure any changes are intentional before they are committed to the repository.
