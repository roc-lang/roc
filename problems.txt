The fourth pattern has this type:

But all the previous patterns have this type: 
    _[Blue]_others_

All patterns in an `match` must have compatible types.

**INCOMPATIBLE MATCH PATTERNS**

**fuzz_crash_023.md:84:2:**

			x

		Blue # After pattern in alt

			Green
		| Red # After alt pattern
			=> {
				x = 12
				x
			}
		lower # After pattern comment
			=> 1
		"foo" => # After arrow comment
			100
		"foo" | "bar" => 200
		[1, 2, 3, .. as rest] # After pattern comment
			=> # After arrow comment
				123 # After branch comment

		# Just a random comment

		[1, 2 | 5, 3, .. as rest] => 123
		[
			1,
			2 | 5,
			3,
			.. # After DoubleDot
				as # Before alias
					rest, # After last pattern in list
		] => 123
		3.14 => 314
		3.14 | 6.28 => 314
		(1, 2, 3) => 123
		(1, 2 | 5, 3) => 123
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2, ..rest } => 12->add(34)
		{ # After pattern record open
			foo # After pattern record field name
				: # Before pattern record field value
					1, # After pattern record field
			bar: 2,
			.. # After spread operator
				rest, # After last field
		} => 12
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2 | 7 } => 12
		{
			foo: 1,
			bar: 2 | 7, # After last record field
		} => 12
		Ok(123) => 123
		Ok(Some(dude)) => dude
		TwoArgs("hello", Some("world")) => 1000
	}
```
  ^^^^^

The fourth pattern has this type:
    _Str_

But all the previous patterns have this type: 
    _[Red][Blue, Green]_others_

All patterns in an `match` must have compatible types.



**TYPE MISMATCH**
This expression is used in an unexpected way:
**fuzz_crash_023.md:155:2:157:3:**
```roc
	match_time(
		..., # Single args with comment
	)
```

It has the type:
    __arg -> _ret_

But here it's being used as:
    _[Red][Blue, Green]_others, _arg2 -> Error_

```roc

**UNDECLARED TYPE**
The type _Value_ is not declared in this scope.

This type is referenced here:
**fuzz_crash_027.md:153:9:153:14:**
```roc
tuple : Value((a, b, c))
```
        ^^^^^


**INVALID IF CONDITION**
This `if` condition needs to be a _Bool_:
**fuzz_crash_027.md:50:5:**
```roc
	if num {
```
    ^^^

Right now, it has the type:
    _U64_

Every `if` condition must evaluate to a _Bool_–either `True` or `False`.

**INCOMPATIBLE MATCH PATTERNS**
The pattern in the third branch of this `match` differs from previous ones:
**fuzz_crash_027.md:64:2:**
```roc
	match a {lue | Red => {
			x x
		}
		Blue		=> 1
		"foo" => # ent
00
		"foo" | "bar" => 20[1, 2, 3, .. as rest] # Aftet
			=> ment


		[1, 2 | 5, 3, .. as rest] => 123
		[
ist
		] => 123
		3.14 => 314
		3.14 | 6.28 => 314
		(1, 2, 3) => 123
		(1, 2 | 5, 3) => 123
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2, ..rest } => 12->add(34)
		{ # Afrd open
			foo #
				: #ue
					1, # Aftd field
			bar: 2,
			..} => 12
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2 | 7 } => 12
		{
			foo: 1,
			} => 12
		Ok(123) => 121000
	}
```
  ^^^^^

The third pattern has this type:
    _Str_

But all the previous patterns have this type: 
    _[Red, Blue]_others_

All patterns in an `match` must have compatible types.



**TYPE MISMATCH**
This expression is used in an unexpected way:
**fuzz_crash_027.md:111:2:113:3:**
```roc
	match_time(
		..., #
	)
```

It has the type:
    __arg -> _ret_

But here it's being used as:
    _[Red, Blue]_others, _arg2 -> Error_

**TYPE MISMATCH**
The first argument being passed to this function has the wrong type:
**fuzz_crash_027.md:142:10:142:41:**
```roc
	stale = some_fn(arg1)?.statod()?.ned()?.recd?
```
	        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This argument has the type:
    _List(Error)_

But the function needs the first argument to be:
    _List(Error)_

I found a type followed by what looks like a type argument, but they need to be connected with parentheses.

Instead of:

Other valid examples:

		Ok(123) => 12
	}

  ^^^^^

The third pattern has this type:
    _Str_

But all the previous patterns have this type: 
    _[Red, Blue]_others_

All patterns in an `match` must have compatible types.

Right now, it has the type:

Every `if` condition must evaluate to a _Bool_–either `True` or `False`.

} else if 10 { # Comment after else open
	A
} else { # Comment after else open
	3
}

The second branch has this type:
    _[A]_others_

But the previous branch has this type:
    _Num(_size)_

All branches in an `if` must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap branches in a tag to make them compatible.

The second branch has this type;

But the previous branch has this type:

All branches in an `match` must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap branches values in a tag to make them compatible.
To learn about tags, see <https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tags>

The fourth pattern has this type:

I was expecting a valid expression, but I found something that doesn't belong here.
This could be a missing operator, incorrect syntax, or a token in the wrong place.

**INCOMPATIBLE LIST ELEMENTS**
The second and third elements in this list have incompatible types:
**let_polymorphism_error.md:1:6:**
```roc
[42, 4.2, "hello"]
```
     ^^^  ^^^^^^^

The second element has this type:
    _Frac(_size)_

However, the third element has this type:
    _Str_

All elements in a list must have compatible types.

Note: You can wrap each element in a tag to make them compatible.

**F64 NOT ALLOWED IN PATTERN**
This floating-point literal cannot be used in a pattern match: `1e100`

This number exceeds the precision range of Roc's `Dec` type and would require F64 representation. Floating-point numbers (F64) cannot be used in patterns because they don't have reliable equality comparison.

Consider one of these alternatives:
• Use a guard condition with a range check
• Use a smaller number that fits in Dec's precision
• Restructure your code to avoid pattern matching on this value

For example, instead of:
`1e100 => ...`
Use a guard:
`n if n > 1e99 => ...`

**F64 NOT ALLOWED IN PATTERN**
This floating-point literal cannot be used in a pattern match: `1e-40`

Every `if` condition must evaluate to a _Bool_–either `True` or `False`.

**INCOMPATIBLE MATCH PATTERNS**
The pattern in the fourth branch of this `match` differs from previous ones:
**syntax_grab_bag.md:84:2:**
```roc

			x = 12
			x
		}
		Blue # After pattern in alt
		| # Before pattern in alt
			Green
		| Red # After alt pattern
			=> {
				x = 12
				x
			}
		lower # After pattern comment
			=> 1
		"foo" => # After arrow comment
			100
		"foo" | "bar" => 200
		[1, 2, 3, .. as rest] # After pattern comment
			=> # After arrow comment
				123 # After branch comment

		# Just a random comment

		[1, 2 | 5, 3, .. as rest] => 123
		[
			1,
			2 | 5,
			3,
			.. # After DoubleDot
				as # Before alias
					rest, # After last pattern in list
		] => 123
		3.14 => 314
		3.14 | 6.28 => 314
		(1, 2, 3) => 123
		(1, 2 | 5, 3) => 123
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2, ..rest } => 12->add(34)
		{ # After pattern record open
			foo # After pattern record field name
				: # Before pattern record field value
					1, # After pattern record field
			bar: 2,
			.. # After spread operator
				rest, # After last field
		} => 12
		{ foo: 1, bar: 2 | 7 } => 12
		{
			foo: 1,
			bar: 2 | 7, # After last record field
		} => 12
		Ok(123) => 123
		Ok(Some(dude)) => dude
		TwoArgs("hello", Some("world")) => 1000
	}
```
  ^^^^^

The fourth pattern has this type:
    _Str_

But all the previous patterns have this type: 
    _[Red][Blue, Green]_others_

All patterns in an `match` must have compatible types.



**TYPE MISMATCH**
This expression is used in an unexpected way:
**syntax_grab_bag.md:155:2:157:3:**
```roc
	match_time(
		..., # Single args with comment
	)
```

It has the type:
    __arg -> _ret_

But here it's being used as:
    _[Red][Blue, Green]_others, _arg2 -> Error_
